# temperature
Just because I want to check the temperature from the command line

## Execute ##
Download the file and run `php temperature.php {cityname}`

The default country is Brazil and if you want to check the temperature in a city from another country, just type the country code (ISO 3166) after the cityname, like: `php temperature.php {cityname} {countrycode}`
